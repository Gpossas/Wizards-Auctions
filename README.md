# Wizard-Auctions
This project is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow WIZARDS to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”
It's a fullstack project that I took inspiration from CS50W by Harvard to learn django, Ajax, Database modeling. <br>
OBS: Unit tests paused by now: <br>
  I used Test-driven development methodology, I made several tests then I decided to use Ajax later, so it break a lot of unit tests. <br>
  May in the future I fix, but the purpose of the project is to learn and not to make a real-world website <br>
